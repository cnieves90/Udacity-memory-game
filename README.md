## About

This game is simply about testing how well a users memory is.

## How to Play

Start by clicking any gray card to reveal its image. Try to match each card with its identical match.
Once 8 pairs have been made, you have won the game. Be careful on how many moves you make because it
can cost you a star. Try to match all 8 pairs under 16 moves in order to win the game with 3 stars.

Test your speed ability by checking the clock each time you win. Keep practicing for a better score

## Download

In order to play the game you clone this repository https://github.com/cnieves90/Udacity-memory-game from Github. Once it has been installed open up the index.html file in your browser and start playing.

## Code Acknowledgement

Shuffle function was provided by Udacity by stackoverflow. Followed walkthrough by Matthew Cranford and converted JavaScript into my own writing.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
